## ðŸŒŸ About Me
I am a highly motivated and dedicated professional with a masterâ€™s degree in Public Administration from Stellenbosch University, specializing in analyzing public financial management systems through the PEFA framework. My research, which includes a comparative analysis of public financial management in Malawi and South Africa, has provided me with deep insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these systems. My experience spans both private and public sector organizations, where I have developed a diverse skill set that includes research, data analysis, report writing, project management/coordination, and stakeholder engagement. I am passionate about inclusive economic development and the implementation of effective reforms. As an avid learner with a keen interest in technology and its impact on public policy, I am committed to driving positive change and innovation in the field of public policy and development. My goal is to contribute to projects that promote transparency, accountability, and sustainable development, utilizing both my analytical skills and my dedication to continuous learning.
